# nail-clipper

A command-line utility for quickly and easily editing video files, with a special emphasis on
choosing a thumbnail from a frame in a given video and embedding it as an attachment within the
same video.

Use `nailgun` to rapidly generate a lot of thumbnails from a given video file (like a machine gun,
hence the name). Use the `-f|--frameskip N` flag to generate a thumbnail every N frames (default: 7).
Use the `-d|--output-dir DIR` flag to set DIR as the target output directory (default: `~/.temp/`).
